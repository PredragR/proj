  # Course projct - Getting and Cleaning Data  
  # This script does the following:
  # 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  # 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  # 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  # 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
  # 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  # assumptions: following packages are installed tidyr,dplyr,data.table, reshape2
  # read test data
  # read train data
  # read features, use them for column names
  # get only features which contain words "maean" and "std"
  # link activity labels with subjects and test data
  # link activity labels with subjects and train data
  # combine two datasets 
  # calculate means, put data into tidy set
  # output tidy data
